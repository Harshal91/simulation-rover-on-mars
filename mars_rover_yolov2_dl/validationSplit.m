function [trainIdx, valIdx] = validationSplit(data, th)
% This function gets the list of files and split them into validation and
% test, considering that we have Left and Right images that are pretty much
% in the same scene. This means that both should be taken to train OR
% validation at the same time.

% Set validation partition to 2.5%. Keep in mind that we have stereo
% images, which means that we need to remove both Left and Right images for
% validation. This means that, in the end, we will have somewhere between
% 2.5 and 5% of validation data.
