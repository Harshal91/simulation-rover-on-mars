function  [z_heights,rocks_pc] = updateTerrainWithDitchesData(rocks_sm,xg,yg,z_heights)

% Function to create ditches with randomized depths at provided locations
% on the main terrain. This function first creates a secondary grid
% representing an ellipsoid and then uses points from this secondary grid
% to edit the Z value of the primary terrain grid at the provide xy locations.

% The function takes the original Z heights matrix of the primary
% terrain as the input and updates and outputs the Z values, which represent
% ditches of different depths.
