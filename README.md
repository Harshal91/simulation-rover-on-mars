# Mars Rover Project GHC

% Copyright 2022 The MathWorks, Inc.

This example models a mars rover performing a sample retrieval task. The rover 
follows a desired path on a rigid terrain surface, stops at the target location 
and uses its manipulator to pick and store a sample from the surface. A path 
planner app is used to find obstacle free paths on an uneven terrain. 

To launch the app run the following command :
>> mars_rover_startup
